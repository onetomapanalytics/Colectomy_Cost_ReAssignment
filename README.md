# Colectomy_Cost_ReAssignment

Evaluating the overlap between the cost of Robotic and Laproscopi Partial Colectomies.

This analysis is focused on the Inpatient Parital colectomies (Laproscopic and Robotic) performed in the state of Florida. Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration, inpatient discharge data was linked with CMS Cost reports data to anlayze the totla and operative costs (cost data was adjusted for inflation) of laroscopic and robotic partial colectomies.

We used usupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms for this project, k-means clustering was utilized to cluster the Cost and then those clusters were modeled using supervised machine learning.  

All the data cleaning and preperation was performed in STATA, whereas trend modeling was performed using R Studio.

Access to FL AHCA is subject to a Data Use Agreement and authorization by the Florida Agency of Health Care Administration, all of the authors on this project have authorization to utilize this data set for research purposes. (CMS Cost reporst data is publicly available)

We have made sure that all the analysis is thoroughly reviewed to be error free, furthermore all the results have been hidden that may lead back to tracing individual identiies. All the coding steps involved in linking, cleaning, and preparing the data for analysis and modeling have been listed below with the name of each file. Code for all steps involved in cleaning, linking, pre processing, and modeling has been shared.
